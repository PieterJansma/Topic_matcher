# Topic Matching ‚Äì Local LLM Toolkit (Qwen + llama.cpp)

Two terminal tools to help you **clean up variable definitions** and **predict taxonomy parents** ‚Äî fully **offline** on your machine with a **quantized** instruction model (e.g., **Qwen3-4B-Instruct Q4_K_M**) served via `llama.cpp`.

## What it does

1. **Compacts messy definitions**
   Reads `Labeled_variables.xlsx` with columns `name`, `parent`, `definition` and writes
   `Labeled_variables.with_llm_short_definition.xlsx` by adding **`llm_short_definition`**.

* Produces **exactly one** concise sentence by default.
* If the original is long, it allows **up to two short sentences** to keep signal.

2. **Predicts the best parent** for each variable
   Uses **`name` + `llm_short_definition`** (falls back to `definition` or just `name`).

* Returns **Top-1** and **Top-3** suggestions.
* Can include a **self-score (0‚Äì100)** and a **two-sentence rationale** per suggestion.
* Supports a quick **`test N`** command to measure **Top-1 / Top-3 accuracy**.

Everything runs **locally** via an **OpenAI-compatible** HTTP endpoint (no data leaves your machine).

---

## Why Top-1 and Top-3?

* **Top-1** is what you‚Äôd auto-apply if you accept the model‚Äôs first choice.
* **Top-3** is practical for **triage/review**: if the gold label appears in the top three, a human can quickly click the right one. This reduces correction time and gives a better sense of usefulness in noisy taxonomies.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.9+)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install deps
pip install pandas openpyxl requests

# 3) Start your local model server (see next section)

# 4) Generate short definitions (interactive; writes a new Excel)
python interactive_compact_defs_all_v2.py

# 5) Predict parents / evaluate (interactive; reads the new Excel)
python predict_parent_interactive.py
```

---

## Run the model locally (llama.cpp)

You‚Äôll run a **quantized** Qwen Instruct model locally and expose it via an OpenAI-style API.

### Quick CLI sanity check

Verify the model loads:

```bash
# User's example (quantized Qwen 3 4B Instruct)
./llama-cli -m ~/Downloads/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

### Start the HTTP server

Run `llama-server` so the Python tools can POST to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`:

```bash
./llama-server \
  -m ~/Downloads/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --port 8080 --host 127.0.0.1
```

> The scripts try both `/v1/chat/completions` and `/chat/completions` automatically.
> If you use another OpenAI-compatible host (e.g., LM Studio), just keep the same base URL.

---

## Scripts & usage

### A) Create compact definitions

**File:** `interactive_compact_defs_all_v2.py`
**Reads:** `Labeled_variables.xlsx`
**Writes:** `Labeled_variables.with_llm_short_definition.xlsx` (adds `llm_short_definition` next to `definition`)

**Run**

```bash
python interactive_compact_defs_all_v2.py
```

**Interactive commands**

* Type a row number (1-based) or comma-separated (e.g., `1, 2, 16`) to preview a compact definition for those rows.
* Type `all` to generate **`llm_short_definition`** for every row and save a new Excel.
* Type `r` to reload the file, `q` to quit.

**Behavior**

* One concise sentence (~10‚Äì22 words).
* If the original `definition` is long (>300 chars), the model may produce **two** short sentences.
* Extremely long inputs are **soft-truncated** in the prompt to avoid server `400` errors.

---

### B) Predict parents, explain, and evaluate

**File:** `predict_parent_interactive.py`
**Reads:** `Labeled_variables.with_llm_short_definition.xlsx`

**Run**

```bash
python predict_parent_interactive.py
```

**Interactive commands**

* `predict N` or `predict 1,2,16` ‚Äî show **Top-1** + **Top-3** predictions.

  * If `llm_short_definition` is missing for that row, the script **generates** one on the fly for context (not saved).
* `test N [seed S]` ‚Äî sample *N* random rows and compute **Top-1 / Top-3** accuracy.

  * Uses a fixed seed by default for reproducibility (change with `seed S`).
* `options` ‚Äî print the full, numbered list of unique parent labels the model sees.
* `r` ‚Äî reload the Excel, `q` ‚Äî quit.

**Sample output (abridged)**

```
Row: 1
name                 : Pregnancy number
parent (original)    : Identifiers
definition (original):
Pregnancy number
------------------------------------------------------------
llm_short_definition (from sheet or generated now):
Number of pregnancies recorded for the subject.
------------------------------------------------------------
[using llm_short_definition for prediction]

PREDICTED parent (top-1): Birth, pregnancy and reproductive health history
mode                    : json   similarity‚âà1.00
confidence              : 72/100 (model self-score)
------------------------------------------------------------
TOP-3 suggestions:
1. Birth, pregnancy and reproductive health history  [score: 72/100 | sim‚âà1.00]
    why: Tracks parity for obstetric context. Strong semantic overlap with reproductive history.
2. Identifiers                                      [score: 18/100 | sim‚âà0.84]
    why: Sometimes stored as a code-like field. Less semantic fit than reproductive history.
3. Demographics                                     [score: 10/100 | sim‚âà0.81]
    why: Could be reported with person attributes. Not primarily a demographic measure.
```

> **Notes**
>
> * *similarity* is a string-match quality vs. your exact option list (not a probability).
> * *confidence* is the model‚Äôs **self-score** (0‚Äì100), normalized to sum ~100 across Top-3. Treat as heuristic.

## Input/Output formats

### Input (required)

`Labeled_variables.xlsx` with columns (case-insensitive):

* `name` *(string)*
* `parent` *(string; your current taxonomy label; used as ‚Äúgold‚Äù in testing)*
* `definition` *(string; may be long)*

### Output (after step A)

`Labeled_variables.with_llm_short_definition.xlsx` adds:

* `llm_short_definition` *(string; the compact definition)*

The predictor reads this file by default.

---

## How it works (under the hood)

* **Definition generation**:
  Uses a strict instruction style (no lists, no marketing language) to produce one compact sentence; for long inputs, up to two short sentences. Long enumerations are truncated in prompt to avoid HTTP 400.

* **Parent classification**:
  Builds a prompt with **all unique `parent` options** from your data. Prefers `llm_short_definition` as context; falls back gracefully to `definition` or `name`.

* **Top-3 JSON with rationale (preferred)**:
  Asks the model to return **strict JSON**:

  ```json
  { "choices": [
    {"label": "<exact option>", "score": 0..100, "why": "<exactly two short sentences>"},
    ...
  ]}
  ```

  If JSON parsing fails, the script falls back to ‚Äúlabels‚Äù or ‚Äúnumbered indices‚Äù.

* **Accuracy**:

  * **Top-1**: first suggestion equals the gold `parent`.
  * **Top-3**: gold appears among the first 3 suggestions.

---

## Configuration knobs

Open the script and adjust:

* `BASE_URL` ‚Äî default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
* `MODEL` ‚Äî e.g., `"gwen-instruct"` (or whatever your server exposes)
* `PROMPT_DEF_CHAR_LIMIT` ‚Äî max definition chars passed to the model (default `1200`)
* `LONG_DEF_CHAR_THRESHOLD` ‚Äî above this, allow **two** short sentences (default `300`)
* `MAX_TOK_OUT` ‚Äî output token cap; increase if JSON gets cut off (default `256`)
* `TEST_SEED` ‚Äî seed for `test N` (default `42`)

---

## Troubleshooting

* **`400 Bad Request` on chat/completions**
  Prompt too large. The scripts **truncate** long definitions; if this still happens, reduce `PROMPT_DEF_CHAR_LIMIT`.

* **LibreSSL / urllib3 warning on macOS**
  It‚Äôs just a warning. If you want to hide it:

  * Pin urllib3 `<2`: `pip install "urllib3<2"`; or
  * Use a newer Python (e.g., 3.12 via Homebrew) and recreate the venv.

* **Server route differences**
  Tools try `/v1/chat/completions` and `/chat/completions`. If you use a different API (e.g., Ollama‚Äôs `/api/chat`), adapt `post_chat` accordingly.

* **Model outputs indices (e.g., `68`)**
  That‚Äôs **numbered mode**. The script maps indices back to labels; type `options` to see the numbering.
